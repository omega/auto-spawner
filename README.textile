h1. auto-spawner

The name isn't particularly good, but it's better than nothing :p

The main idea is that I wanted a quicker way to setup a running version of any perl-app under development, for testing etc. This will run a collective starman instance, with each app mounted under `/name`

The apps are loaded from ./projects/*

For now it only supports perl and plack based apps. If a new project is detected, it will reload the starman instances, and also it will install deps.

It will also reload if a change to /lib is detected, after attempting to install new deps.

run repull in a cronjob.
